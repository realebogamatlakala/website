              <i><b>Cape Town One Day Couple's Itinerary</b></i>
              <br>
              <br>
              Cape Town is a diverse and multifaceted city, with so much to see and do. Spending one day in Cape Town might seem too short,
               but it's still totally possible to pack it full of memorable experiences. Because it is also a relatively small city, you can
                see quite a lot of it without feeling too rushed. Here's how to get the most out of one day in Cape Town.

              <br>
              <br>
              With only one day in Cape Town, you have to start it right. Take the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway up to the top of this iconic Cape Town attraction.
               The cable car rotates as it ascends, giving you 360º views of the city, harbour, Robben Island, and the surrounding mountains. The first trip up is at 8am between November and April,
                and 8:30am from May to October.

              <br>
              What’s a visit to Cape Town without taking a little time to explore the fine wines and gorgeous scenery that have made the city famous? Groot Constantia is set in the lush Constantia valley.
               Head to one of the great restaurants for lunch. Simon’s offers relaxed al fresco dining and delicious deli-style treats. Pro-tip: order one of their fantastic picnic baskets, find a good spot under an old oak tree,
                and add a bottle of Groot Constantia wine for a perfect afternoon.
               Alternatively, Jonkershuis specializes in decadent lunches next to the fire or outside under the ancient oaks, for a more formal lunch.

                Almost anywhere you choose to eat will have incredible views. There is also world-class shopping, with stores open late, in case you want to pick up gifts, 
                luxury goods, or even just some groceries.
